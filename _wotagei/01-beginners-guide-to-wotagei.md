# Learning Wotagei
These are a couple of important notes that must be kept in mind when learning wotagei.
 + *Focus on correctness of waza before speed.* Speed is a just a matter of how fluid you are with the waza; this comes with practice. If a waza is executed incorrectly it will look bad.
 + Don't get discouraged if you can't learn a waza immediately. When starting, a waza take some time for your body to memorize the movements.
 + Always stretch! Wotagei is intensive on both your back, shoulders and legs. When you start you will be sore, but this can be minimized with proper stretching and warm up.
 + Cyalumes are not needed to learn wotagei. Cyalumes are only really used during performance. During practice people use dead glow sticks or just their hands.
