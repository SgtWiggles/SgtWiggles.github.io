When doing wotagei, it is required that both of your feet are firmly planted on the ground.
The general rule of thumb is that your legs are spread out about 2-3 as wide as your shoulder width. 
This stance should be fairly relaxed, with a slight bend in the knees.

In beginning, you may not have the strength or flexibility to hold a stance this wide. 
If this is the case, then it is okay to have a skinnier stance; there is no point in forcing an uncomfortably wide stance.
