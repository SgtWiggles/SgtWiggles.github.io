# OAD 

OAD is a commonly used waza during the A-Melo.
Each swing takes two beats, with your arms swinging left to right.
It is demonstrated in the video below.

Below describes which points to look out for when practicing OAD.

# Starting Position

As with most of wotagei, you start from the right side, thus you will be swinging from left to right.
Your stance should be as described in <a href="/wotagei/stance">Basic Stance</a>.
Thus, OAD starts in a position similar to the photo below.

Note that the right elbow is pointing straight up, and both hands are on the right side by your head.

# Initial Swing

Begin by swinging your arms from right to left.
It is important that your arms are completely extended during the swing.
The photo below shows an approximate path your hands should take when doing OAD.

</figure>

Getting to this point should take about 1 beat.
Your left arm will be pointing towards the sky, and the right arm almost parallel with the floor.
This is followed by a snap which completes one swing of OAD.

# Ending Snap
Continuing from above, on the final beat your arms should snap together as follows.

Note that after the final snap, your ending position should be as shown below.

Your body should form a straight line with your leg, depending on which side you are swinging from.
To achieve this, the knee your bending down to will be bent. 
This is shown with the red line in the photo above.

Your head should be facing straight forward and parallel to the floor.
This is shown by the blue line.

As shown by green line, your elbow should be pointing upwards, ideally perpendicular to the ground.

This completes a single swing of OAD. 
This is usually repeated 4 or 6 times depending on when it is used, which will be covered later.
When all of this is put together, the final waza looks as follows.
