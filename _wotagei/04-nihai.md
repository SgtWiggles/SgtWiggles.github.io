Nihai Ohai is commonly used during the A-Melo, and is used after OAD.
Thus in the video, there are two swings of OAD as build up to the Nihai Ohai.
The waza takes 4 beats in total, and is demonstrated in the video below.

# Starting Position

As this a lead up after OAD, both of your hands will start by your head on the right side; similar to the photo below.
As you enter Nihai Ohai, your head will turn towards the ground. 
This is illustrated by the red arrow.

# Overhead Swing
This part of the Nihai Ohai takes one beat. 
Without separating your hands, bring them over your head and down to where your left foot is.
Your hands will follow a path similar to the red in the image below.

# Returning Swing
This motion will take one beat.
Without separating your hands, bring your hands in a straight line across your body, until your hands are at chest height.
This is indicated by the red line in the picture below.

# Ending Flip
The final motion of Nihai Ohai takes up two beats. 
You start by dropping your hands downwards and bringing them back up in a circle motion. 
While your hands are coming back up, be sure to bring your hands outwards to make the circle bigger.
Once your hands get closer together, make sure that the palms of your hands are facing downwards, once your hands are together at the apex of the circle, they should both have their palms facing down. 
Once you get the basic technique down, an advanced technique you can implement is to flip your hands inward when executing the circle movement. 
This will some extra flair to your Nihai Ohai.

Nihai Ohai should then end in a position where you can naturally begin OAD.

Thus when using lights, the Nihai Ohai looks a follows.
