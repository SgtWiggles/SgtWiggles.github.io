Nihai Ohai is commonly used during the A-Melo, and is used after OAD.
Thus in the video, there are two swings of OAD as build up to the Nihai Ohai.
The waza takes 4 beats in total, and is demonstrated in the video below.

# Starting Position

As this a lead up after OAD, both of your hands will start by your head on the right side; similar to the photo below.
As you enter Nihai Ohai, your head will turn towards the ground. 
This is illustrated by the red arrow.

# Overhead Swing
This part of the Nihai Ohai takes one beat. 
Without separating your hands, bring them over your head and down to where your left foot is.
Your hands will follow a path similar to the red in the image below.

This is indicated by the red line in the picture below.
