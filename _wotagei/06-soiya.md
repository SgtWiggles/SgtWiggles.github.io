8 beats long

Make sure your arm comes upwards from behind on the first two beats.
Spinning should then take 2 more beats.
The strikes are then go as follows:
1) Right arm goes to left
2) Left arm goes to right foot. Your right arm should retract here.
3) Right arm over the head, while retracting left arm.
4) Left arm over the head. Both arms should be over your head at this point
