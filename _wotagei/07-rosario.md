# Overview
Rosario is a waza that is mainly used during the B-melo and is used in conjunction with Los Angeles. 
You will rarely see Rosario outside of B-melo, however it can be seen in some choreographies and unique waza. Like with Nihai Ohai, we will be focusing on how it is performed during the B-melo. 
Unlike all the other waza we have learned up to this point, this waza is only four beats in length.

# Starting Stance

If you are performing both the A-melo and B-melo in one take, you’ll most likely be in the ending stance for Soiya as discussed in the Soiya tutorial. If you are recording the B-melo as a separate cut, you can start in the default starting wotagei stance. 

# Look at the Sky (Again)
This movement is identical to that in <a href="/wotagei/soiya">Soiya</a>.
Your right arm comes up in the exact same fashion.

# Spin and Spin (Again)
This part is the same as Spin and Spin in <a href="/wotagei/soiya">Soiya</a>.
These first 2 parts take 3 beats in total.

# Dig the Ground
The final beat is what differs from Soiya. 
Instead of thrusting in the direction of your feet, 
you bring your arm behind you, rotating up until your hand is near your head.
You then strike straight down towards the ground.

Once all put together it should look something similar to as follows.

# What Next?

It can be noted that Rosario is only four beats in length. 
Thus, to make it align with the eight beat count, it is generally performed in multiples of two (2, 4, 6, ...).
After Rosario it can be followed with Los Angeles or go straight into the Sabi (Chorus).
