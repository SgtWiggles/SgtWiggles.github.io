Considered to be one of the highest points of Wotagei, torch wazas consist of timing two separate motions of the left and right arms to create various circles around you. 
These wazas are extraordinarily difficult and extra care must be taken when learning them.
It should take about 2 weeks before you get used to the fundamental wazas.
After that it should take about another week to be able to perform Shiranui under pressure.

There are many expert Uchi Shi in Japan who cannot perform torch wazas, but are still considered to be the best.
