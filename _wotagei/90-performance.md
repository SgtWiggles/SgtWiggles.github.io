# Video
Camera settings are important when recording Wotagei, as they change how long the streaks of light are.
The most commonly changed settings are:
+ Frame Rate: Usually set and left at 24 fps. Anything faster and streaks won't form at all. Anything slower and the video looks choppy.
+ Shutter Speed: Usually set to 1/25, depending on lighting conditions. This has become the agreed standard when recording wotagei. If you increase this, the streaks of light get longer.
+ ISO: Changes how bright the shot is. It  usually sits around 800, but is adjusted depending on the lighting conditions. If it is too dim ISO is increased.
+ F-Stop: Left as low as possible, as long as you stay in focus in the shot.
