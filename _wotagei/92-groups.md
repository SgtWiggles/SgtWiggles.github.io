For inspiration (or entertainment), names of various wotagei groups will be listed here.

## Ginyu forcE (ギニュ～特戦隊)
Considered to be the pioneers of modern Wotagei/Cyalume Dance. Formerly known as Ginyu Tokusentai, many of their current and past members have been affiliated with other big Wotagei groups in Japan including JKz, Fly-N and Shooters. Ginyu members travel to international conventions to spread Wotagei/Cyalume Dance culture as well as being hosts and judges of the Cyalume Dance World Battle (CDWB) Qualifiers.
## Kita no Uchishi Tachi (北の打ち師達)
A very popular Japanese YouTuber variety channel, Kita no Uchishi Tachi started as a Wotagei group based in Hokkaido. It can be argued that KitaUchi kickstarted the mass popularity of Wotagei/Cyalume Dance in Japan with their wildly popular videos such as their Kimi no Na wa Wotagei videos, exposing many both in Japan and internationally to the art of Wotagei/Cyalume Dance.
## JKz
One of the popular Wotagei groups in Japan. One of the older Wotagei groups, they have collaborated with many Wotagei groups in Japan including both Ginyu forcE and Kita no Uchishi Tachi. Some of their members, most notably Perikan (ペリカン) is a member of both Ginyu forcE and JKz and often collaborating with KitaUchi.
## Fly-N
Another popular Wotagei group based in Japan, Fly-N is known for their incorporation of Torch into their choreography, with most of their members being proficient in Torch waza. Their members are also of note, with notably ROTO (ロト) who is most famous for his original waza ROTO no Monshou (ロトの紋章), Shun (シュン) who is famous for his original waza Suzaku (朱雀) and Mimiko, one of the first popular female Uchishi part of a major group.
