Inspired by the 1 hour of nonstop wotagei challenge done by 北の打ち師達 (Kita no Uchishi Tachi), the Spartan Wotagei Challenge is a rigorous routine of wotagei designed to improve your stamina, flexibility, form and endurance to help improve your wotagei performance routine. 
This challenge also works well as a fitness routine designed to lose weight. 
This challenge should take around one hour. 
The Spartan Wotagei Challenge consists of:

+ 100 OADs
    + 50 at 120 BPM
    + 50 at 160 - 180 BPM
+ 100 Rosario
+ 50 Los Angeles
+ 50 Thundersnake
+ 5 Minute Break
+ 100 Romance
+ 100 Snake Thunder
+ 10 Sabi Waza of Your Choice
+ 10 Song Sets at 120 BPM
    + 2 OAD Sets
    + 4 Rosario
    + Thundersnake
    + 3 Romance Sets
+ 1 Minute Breaks in between each task

Ideally, you want to do this nonstop in one hour sessions. 
However, take breaks whenever needed to not overly exert yourself. 
Remember to also stretch beforehand so as to not injure yourself during the routine (Unless you want to be very sore for a couple of days).
